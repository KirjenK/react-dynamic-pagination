# React Dynamic Pagination Project with Intersection Observer

This project is an example of implementing dynamic pagination on the React platform using Intersection Observer.

## Technologies Used
* React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types and improves developer productivity.
* Intersection Observer: A browser API that allows for efficient tracking of element visibility changes in the viewport.

## Description

Dynamic pagination is a way to divide a large amount of content into pages to improve performance and user experience. Instead of loading and displaying all the data at once, pagination allows loading only small portions of data as needed when scrolling the page.

This project utilizes React and TypeScript to create dynamic pagination. The main mechanism used to determine when to load the next batch of data is Intersection Observer.

## Functionality
* Display a list of data with dynamic pagination.
* Automatically load the next batch of data when reaching the end of the current page.
* Display a loading indicator during data loading.
* Handle errors during data loading.
