### Description

Dynamic pagination is a way to divide a large amount of content into pages to improve performance and user experience. Instead of loading and displaying all the data at once, pagination allows loading only small portions of data as needed when scrolling the page.

This project utilizes React and TypeScript to create dynamic pagination. The main mechanism used to determine when to load the next batch of data is Intersection Observer.

### Functionality
* Display a list of data with dynamic pagination.
* Automatically load the next batch of data when reaching the end of the current page.
* Display a loading indicator during data loading.
* Handle errors during data loading.
